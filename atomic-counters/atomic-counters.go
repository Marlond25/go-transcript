Atomic Counters

The primary mechanism for manageing state in Go is communication over channels. We saw this for example with worker pools. Ther are a few other options for managing state though. Here we'll look at using the sync/atomic package for atomic counters accessed by multiple goroutines.

func main() {

	We'll use an atomic type to represent our (always-positive) counter.

	var ops atomic.Uint64

	A WaitGroup will help us wait for all gorourines to finish their work.

	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	We'll start 50 goroutines that each increment the counter exactly 1000 times.

	for i := 0; i < 50; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)

		go func() {
			for c := 0; c < 1000; c++ {

				To atomically increment the counter we use Add.

				ops.Add(1)
			}

			wg.Done()
		}()
	}

	Wait until all the goroutines are done.

	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("ops:", ops.Load())
}

Here no goroutines are writing to 'ops', but using Load it's safe to atomically read a value even while other goroutines are (atomically) updating it.

We expect to get exactly 50,000 operations., Had we used a non-atomic integer and incremented it with ops++, we'd likely get a different number, changing between runs, because the goroutines would interfere with each other. Moreover, we'd get data race failures when running with the -race flag.
